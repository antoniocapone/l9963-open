# Features that will be implemented in the future

1. [ ] Error flags handling.
1. [x] Current measure.
1. [x] Balancing control features.
1. [x] Now the driver can handle only manual balancing. Also timed balancing will be implemented.
1. [ ] Now the driver can handle only on demand conversion mode. Also cyclic conversion will be implemented.
1. [ ] In case you use timed balancing, now you must use the fine bal timer resolution, so the L9963_SetBalancingTimerResolution function is useless. Extend.

# Issues and bug that must be resolved

1. [ ] SoftwareReset and GoToSleep functions.
